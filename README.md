# rc-circuit

##### **RC Circut building process**
We used a plan from the internet to begin building our circuit. We decided on the parts list seen below:
- PT2262 Encoder
- Pt2272 Decoder
- Transmitter module
- Reciever module
- IC 7805 voltage regulator (x2)
- 1N4148 diode x4
- 560 ohm resistors x5
- 240k resistor
- 1.2M resistor
- 10 resistor x4
- 4x alco switch
- 2x C&K switch
- 2x 9v battery
- battery lead off
- LED x6
- misc wires

Our steps:
Step 1: Build dummy circuit while waiting for parts to arrive:
While waiting for the arrival of the encoder, decoder, reciever, transmitter and voltage regulator, we wired up the circuits shown in the (reciever circuit)[https://github.com/luncheater1234/rc-circuit/blob/master/reciever%20circuit.png] and (transmitter circuit)[https://github.com/luncheater1234/rc-circuit/blob/master/transmitter%20curcit.png] we used spare integrated curcits from the lab to substitute for the ICs which had not yet arrived. Our dummy transmitter is (here) and our dummy reviever is (here).  

We initially used this wiring diagram to wire up our transmtter and reciever circuits (transmitter circuit.jp
We had several issues: 
The Pt2272 and Pt2262 did not function as they should, failing to light up the lightbulbs that showed they had power
we initally used the wiring diagrams reciever curcit and transmitter circuit. However, we bought the pt2262 and 2272 instead of the ht12D and ht12E 
Our plan was to use the components listed in the second set of wiring diagrams [reciever circuit 2 and transmitter circuit 2] in the circuit shown in the first set of wiring diagrams.
Clearly, our plan had some issues from the outset. We had rouble making progress during the first few days
