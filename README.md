## **RC Circut Building Process**
Power Supply:
For each circuit, we need a power supply. To make the power supply, use an ic 7805 voltage regulator. The voltage regulator takes the 9v from the battery and drops it to 5v, which is a usable voltage for the rf modules, encoder, and decoders. The ic 7805 has three prongs: one for the 9v input power, one ground, and one for the 5v output. These are shown below:
Fig 1!!!!
2 power supplies will be needed: one for the transmitter circuit and one for the receiver circuit.
Now, we learn how to make the transmitter circuit
Fig 2!!!!
This is the diagram of how to wire up the pt2262. Note the semi-circular indentation at the top indicating the orientation. Here are the definitions of  the various pins:
|Pin Name|Explanation|
----------------------
|A0-A7|Extra input/output pins. Not connected to anything in our circuit|
|Vss|Ground|
|Vcc|Power in|
|DOUT|data output to transmitter module|
|OSC2/OSC1|oscillator output -see more about finding the correct R values below|
|TE|Goes to ground|
|D0-3/A11-8|data inputs- we connect to switches|


## **Difficulties**
The main problems we encountered were with our voltage, buttons, resistors, ledâ€™s, breadboard, diodes, and transmitter chip. The first time our circuit did not work we assumed that had applied too high a voltage and were burning out our components. This turned out to be false, as we were using a 9V battery to power parts with power ratings of 5-15V. We continued to test all of our connections to ensure they had the correct amount of voltage until we discovered that the breadboard we were using had a break in connection in the middle of its power strips that was causing only half of our circuit to be powered. Upon moving to a different breadboard we were able to make one led light up using the circuits described above.
