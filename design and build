####**RC Circut building process**
We used a plan from the internet to begin building our circuit. We decided on the parts list seen below:
-PT2262 Encoder
-Pt2272 Decoder
-Transmitter module
-Reciever module
-IC 7805 voltage regulator (x2)
-1N4148 diode x4
-560 ohm resistors x5
-240k resistor
-1.2M resistor
-10 resistor x4
-4x alco switch
-2x C&K switch
-2x 9v battery
-battery lead off
-LED x6
-misc wires

We initially used this wiring diagram to wire up our transmtter and reciever circuits (transmitter circuit.jpg)
We had several issues: 
The Pt2272 and Pt2262 did not function as they should, failing to light up the lightbulbs that showed they had power
we initally used this wiring diagram;  but bought the pt2262 and 2272 instead
